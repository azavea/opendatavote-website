---

### Rules
The following rules apply to the operation of the contest:

#### For the nonprofit organization participants:
- Nonprofit organizations may nominate more than one data set, but only one data set will move forward to the voting phase
- Data set nominations should adhere to the following guidelines:
  - Data sets gathered by the City of Philadelphia, other public authorities or civic-oriented organizations
  - If the data were made public, it would not result in a privacy or security concern (examples of this might include individual medical records, individual human services records or individual criminal history)
  - The data exists but is not yet available to the public – we are interested in data that is currently gathered but is not available, rather than data that perhaps could be gathered but does not currently exist
  - Data sets that will have the potential for a positive social impact if they were available
  - By “data set”, we mean machine-readable, structured data, either downloadable or as a structure data application programming interface (API). For the purposes of this contest, data sets that are currently only available in PDF or MS Word form will be considered “not available”
  - We would like to know how you would use this data if it was available. How will this data help you fulfill your mission?
- Data set nominations will need to include the following information:
  - Organization Name:
  - Organization URL
  - Contact Person
  - Contact Phone Number
  - Contact EMail
  - Data Set to Nominate
  - If this data set were available, how would your organization use it?
  - How would this data set contribute to your organization's mission?
- Organizations may encourage people to vote for their project using any means available to them including: outreach, newsletters, email, Twitter, Facebook, Google+, etc.
- If your organization wins a prize, you will be expected to have a representative attend one or more of the hack-a-thon events in order to pitch 

#### For the general public:
- You must register with OpenDataPhilly in order to vote
- One vote per week per individual person for this contest – if you vote early, you’ll be able to vote more often!!
- Once registered, you are free to vote for other data sets through the normal OpenDataPhilly nomination system and may vote on multiple data sets in this context
- Any attempt to automate the voting process by generating fake email addresses and names will render those votes ineligible and may disqualify the nonprofit organization

#### Other rules & notes:
- The Contest Partners will make the final selection of data sets that will be made available for voting
- The Contest Partners cannot guarantee that the data sets that win prizes will be released by the City
- While in many cases, software developed at hack-a-thon events will be made available under an open source license, the Contest Partners cannot guarantee this. The availability, release and ownership of a specific software or web site that results from the hack-a-thon events is at the discretion of the individuals developing the software
