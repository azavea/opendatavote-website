In 2011, the OpenDataPhilly project team launched a public awareness campaign similar to OpenDataVote in order to encourage the City of Philadelphia to release more data sets that could potentially serve the nonprofit community. The effort was quite successful - it attracted more attention to the community-driven open data effort in Philadelphia and many of the nominated data sets have been released in the years since then.

### Lasting Impact
A lot has changed since 2011. The City of Philadelphia now has a Chief Data Officer, open data is now part of the City's policy, and there is an active staff supporting the initiative. Open Data Philly has grown from about 100 data sets to almost 350, and open data is being used in many locations across the region. Much has changed outside Philadelphia as well. Pennsylvania now has its own state open data portal (https://data.pa.gov/), and the Pittsburgh region has the Western Pennsylvania Regional Data Center (http://www.wprdc.org/).

### Promotion of Open Data Repositories
While OpenDataPhilly is not a government project, many of the data sets included in the catalog are from municipal government agencies. An important objective of OpenDataVote is to promote great availability of such data. Many new data sets, APIs, and applications have been added to the catalog since its launch at the end of April 2011.
