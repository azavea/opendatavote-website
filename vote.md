### The public voting phase will begin on April 10, 2017
The current OpenDataVote is in coordination with [The City of Philadelphia](http://www.phila.gov/it/Innovation/Pages/default.aspx) & [OpenDataPhilly](https://www.opendataphilly.org/).

The data nomination phase is currently underway!

Nonprofit organizations should visit the [Nominate Data](/nominate-data) page to enter one or more existing data sets that would be useful to the organization, but aren't currently available to the public.

When the voting phase opens on April 10, 2017, the public can vote for either their favorite organization or the data set they think should be prioritized for release.

OpenDataVote Partners will work with government representatives to publish the data sets that receive the most votes from the public. Nonprofits will be awarded prize money from OpenDataVote Sponsors if their data nomination wins!
